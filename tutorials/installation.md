# Overview

This tutorial describes how to install Gazebo Utils on Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows via either a binary distribution or from source.

# Install

We recommend following the [Binary Install](#binary-install) instructions to get up and running as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The [Source Install](#source-install) instructions should be used if you need the very latest software improvements, you need to modify the code, or you plan to make a contribution.

## Binary Install

### Ubuntu Linux

Setup your computer to accept software from *packages.osrfoundation.org*:

```{.sh}
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
```

Setup keys:

```{.sh}
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

Install Gazebo Utils:

```
sudo apt install libgz-utils<#>-dev
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
which version you need.

### macOS

On macOS, add OSRF packages:
  ```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  brew tap osrf/simulation
  ```

Install Gazebo utils:
  ```
  brew install gz-utils<#>
  ```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
which version you need.

### Windows

Install [Conda package management system](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html).
Miniconda suffices.

Create if necessary, and activate a Conda environment:
```
conda create -n gz-ws
conda activate gz-ws
```

Install `gz-utils`:
```
conda install libgz-utils<#> --channel conda-forge
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
which version you need.

## Source Install

Source installation can be performed in UNIX systems by first installing the
necessary prerequisites followed by building from source.

### Ubuntu

1. Install tools
  ```
  sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git gnupg lsb-release wget
  ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils -b gz-utils<#>
    ```
    Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
    which version you need.

3. Install dependencies

    ```
    sudo apt -y install \
      $(sort -u $(find . -iname 'packages-'`lsb_release -cs`'.apt' -o -iname 'packages.apt' | tr '\n' ' '))
    ```

4. Configure and build

    ```
    cd gz-utils; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
    ```

5. Optionally, install Gazebo Utils

    ```
    sudo make install
    ```

### macOS

1. Clone the repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils -b ign-utils<#>
  ```
  Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
  which version you need.

2. Install dependencies
  ```
  brew install --only-dependencies gz-utils<#>
  ```
  Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
  which version you need.

3. Configure and build
  ```
  cd gz-utils
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```

4. Optionally, install
  ```
  sudo make install
  ```
### Windows

This assumes you have created and activated a Conda environment while installing the Prerequisites.

1. Navigate to where you would like to build the library, and clone the repository.
  ```
  # Optionally, append `-b gz-utils#` (replace # with a number) to check out a specific version
  git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils.git
  ```

2. Configure and build
  ```
  cd gz-utils
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF  # Optionally, -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path\to\install
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

3. Optionally, install
  ```
  cmake --install . --config Release
  ```

# Documentation

API and tutorials can be found at [https://gazebosim.org/libs/utils](https://gazebosim.org/libs/utils).

You can also generate the documentation from a clone of this repository by following these steps.

1. You will need Doxygen. On Ubuntu Doxygen can be installed using

  ```

2. Clone the repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils
  ```

3. Configure and build the documentation.
  ```
  cd gz-utils
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make doc
  ```

4. View the documentation by running the following command from the build directory.
  ```
  firefox doxygen/html/index.html
  ```
