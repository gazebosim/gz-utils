# Note on deprecations
A tick-tock release cycle allows easy migration to new software versions.
Obsolete code is marked as deprecated for one major release.
Deprecated code produces compile-time warnings. These warning serve as
notification to users that their code should be upgraded. The next major
release will remove the deprecated code.

## Gazebo Utils 3.X to 4.X

<!--
The default value of `GZ_UTILS_VENDOR_CLI11` is now set to `OFF`, so that
an external version of `cli11` will be preferred by default. This is in
preparation to remove the vendored version (see
[issue #135](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils/issues/135)).
-->

## Gazebo Utils 2.X to 3.X

The `ignition` namespace, `ignition/` header files, `IGN_` prefixed macros,
and `IgnitionFormatter` class have been removed.

## Gazebo Utils 1.X to 2.X

* The `ignition` namespace is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
  Use `gz` instead.

* Header files under `ignition/...` are deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
  Use `gz/...` instead.

* The following `IGN_` prefixed macros are deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
  Additionally, they will only be available when including the corresponding `ignition/...` header.
  Use the `GZ_` prefix instead.
  * `IGN_UTILS_TEST_DISABLED_ON_WIN32`
  * `IGN_UTILS_TEST_DISABLED_ON_MAC`
  * `IGN_UTILS_TEST_DISABLED_ONLY_ON_LINUX`
  * `IGN_UTILS_IMPL_PTR_FWD`
  * `IGN_UTILS_UNIQUE_IMPL_PTR_FWD`
  * `IGN_UTILS_IMPL_PTR`
  * `IGN_UTILS_UNIQUE_IMPL_PTR`
  * `IGN_UTILS_WARN_IGNORE__NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR`, `IGN_UTILS_WARN_RESUME__NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR`
  * `IGN_UTILS_WARN_IGNORE__DLL_INTERFACE_MISSING`, `IGN_UTILS_WARN_RESUME__DLL_INTERFACE_MISSING`
  * `IGN_UTILS_WARN_IGNORE__DEPRECATED_DECLARATION`, `IGN_UTILS_WARN_RESUME__DEPRECATED_DECLARATION`

* The project name has been changed to use the `gz-` prefix, you **must** use the `gz` prefix!
  * This also means that any generated code that use the project name (e.g. CMake variables, in-source macros) would have to be migrated.
  * Some non-exhaustive examples of this include:
    * `GZ_<PROJECT>_<VISIBLE/HIDDEN>`
    * CMake `-config` files
    * Paths that depend on the project name

* The `IgnitionFormatter` class is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use `GzFormatter` instead.

## Gazebo Utils 1.2 to 1.3

Recommended migration:
Utils 1.3.0 introduces the `ExtraTestMacros.hh` headers that are also in gz-cmake.
This is an effort to remove all headers from gz-cmake and locate them in gz-utils.
To update, replace all instances of `ignition/utilities/ExtraTestMacros.hh` with `ignition/utils/ExtraTestMacros.hh`
In the future, `ignition/utilities/ExtraTestMacros.hh` will be removed from gz-cmake.

## Gazebo Utils 0.X to 1.X
